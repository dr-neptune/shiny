# Dynamic UI 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(shiny)
```

There are three key techniques for creating dynamic user interfaces: 

- using update functions to modify the parameters of input controls 
- using tabsetPanel to conditionally show and hide parts of the ui 
- using uiOutput and renderUI to generate selected parts of the user interface with code 

A word of warning: These can make your app harder to reason about
