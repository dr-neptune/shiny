# Reactivity

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(shiny)
```

In shiny we express our server logic using reactive programming. The key idea of reactive programming is that we specify a graph of dependencies so that when an input changes, all related outputs are automatically updated. 

# The Server Function

The server function is a bit more difficult to cover than the ui because each instance of the app needs to be independent from the other instances. This way if user A moves a slider, user B doesnt also see that same slider moving. 

Shiny achieves this independence by invoking the server function each time a new session starts. Server functions take 3 parameters which are handled by the shiny session: 

- input 
- output
- session 

## Input 

The input argument is a list like object which contains all the input data sent from the browser, named according to the input id.

If we have an input named "count", we can access it via input$count. The value will be dynamically updated by the browser. 

Unlike a typical list, input objects are read only. This means we can't update them within a function, like so

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    input$count <- 10
}
```

This will cause an error. This is because the browser is the one source of truth for shiny. If we modify the value in R, we could introduce consistencies. There are functions like updateNumericInput that modify the value in the browser. These will be covered in chapter 7. 

input is also selective about what can read it. To read from input, you must be in a reactive context created by a function like renderText or reactive. This is an important constraint which allows outputs to automatically update when an input changes. 

## Output 

Output is also a list like object named according to the output id. The main difference is that we use it for sending output rather than receiving input. You always use the output object in concert with a render function

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
    textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$greeting <- renderText("Hello, Human!")
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The render function does two things: 

- it sets up a special reactive context that automatically tracks what inputs the output uses 
- it converts the output of your R code into HTML suitable for display on a web page

Like input, output is picky about how it is used. It will fail if 

- you forget the render function 
- you attempt to read from an output

# Reactive Programming

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
    textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
    textOutput("greeting"))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$greeting <- renderText({
        paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")})}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

This is the big idea in shiny -- you dont need to tell an output when to update, because shiny automatically figures it out for you. Shiny performs the action given to it every time we update input$name. The app essentially provides shiny with recipes as opposed to commands. This makes shiny declarative as opposed to imperative. 

In **imperative** programming, we issue a command and it is carried out immediately. This is what we usually do when we write an analysis script in R or python.

In **declarative** programming, you express higher level goals or describe important constraints and rely on someone else to decide how or when to translate that into action. 

## Laziness 

Apps in shiny are lazy by default. This means that if your code contains errors, it will generally still run but it may not give you back what you wanted. If you are working on a shiny app and you can't figure out why your code won't run, double check that your ui and server functions are using the same identifiers. 

```{r}

ui <- fluidPage(
    textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
    textOutput("greeting"))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$greeting <- renderText({
        paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")})}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

    output$greeting <- renderText({
        paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")})}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## The Reactive Graph 

Shiny is backed by a reactive graph which describes how inputs and outputs are handled. 

The reactive graph contains one symbol for every input and output, and we connect the input and output whenever the output accesses the input. 


#+DOWNLOADED: /tmp/screenshot.png @ 2020-01-04 17:16:05
[[file:screenshot_2020-01-04_17-16-05.png]]

This tells us that greeting will be need to be recomputed whenever name is changed. 

There is also an addon called reactlog which will draw the graph for you and show a breakdown over time. 

(reactlog)[https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/articles/reactlog.html]

Here is the hello reactlog program. Once the app is run, launch reactlog by pressing ctrl F3

```{r}
options(shiny.reactlog = TRUE)

library(reactlog)
library(plotly)

ui <- fluidPage(
    selectInput("var", "Choose a variable.", choices = names(diamonds)),
    plotlyOutput("plot"))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$plot <- renderPlotly({
        plot_ly(x = diamonds[[input$var]])})}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

There is one other component that will arise in the reactive graph: the reactive expression. For now we can think of them as a tool that reduces duplication in our reactive code by introducting additional nodes into the reactive graph. 

We dont need a reactive expression in this simple app, but here is one anyways to illustrate:

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    text <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!"))
    output$greeting <- renderText(text())
}
```

[[file:screenshot_2020-01-04_17-38-34.png]]

## Execution Order 

The order in which your code is run is determined by the reactive graph. 

For example, we could switch around the code in the server function above

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$greeting <- renderText(text())
    text <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!"))}
```

In a normal code environment this wouldnt work. Shiny is lazy, so the code is only ran when the session starts, after text has been created. 

## Exercises

```{r}
server1 <- function(input, output, session) {
    c <- reactive(input$a + input$b)
    e <- reactive(c() + input$d)
    output$f <- renderText(e())
}
```

server2 <- function(input, output, session) {
    x <- reactive(input$x1 + input$x2 + input$x3)
    y <- reactive(input$y1 + input$y2)
    output$z <- renderText(x() / y())
}
```

    b <- reactive(a() + input$b)
}

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
    textInput("a", "Enter Text"),

)

server4 <- function(input, output, session) {

    b <- reactive(a())
    output$c <- renderText(b())
}

shinyApp(ui, server4)
```

The reactive graph can not contain a cycle. If it does contain a cycle, shiny is not able to reach b because it has not evaluated a, and it can not evaluate a because it has not evaluated b.

# Reactive Expressions 

Reactive expressions are important for two reasons: 

- They give shiny more information so that it can do less recomputation when inputs change, making apps more efficient
- They make it easier for humans to understand the app by simplifying the reactive graph 

Reactive expressions have a flavor of both inputs and outputs:

- Like inputs, we can use the results of a reactive expression in an output 
- Like outputs, reactive expressions depend on inputs and automatically know when they need updating 

We will use the terminology **producers** to refer to either reactive inputs or expressions and **consumers** to refer to either reactive expressions or outputs.

## The Motivation

Imagine we want to compare two simulated datasets with a plot and a hypothesis test. 

histogram() visualizes the two distributions and t_test() uses a t test to compare means and summarizes the results with a string

```{r}
histogram <- function(x1, x2, binwidth = 0.1, xlim = c(-3, 3)) {
    df <- data.frame(
        x = c(x1, x2),
        g = c(rep("x1", length(x1)), rep("x2", length(x2))))

    df %>%
        ggplot(aes(x, fill = g)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = binwidth) +
        coord_cartesian(xlim = xlim)
}

t_test <- function(x1, x2) {
    test <- t.test(x1, x2)

    sprintf(
        "p value: %0.3f\n[%0.2f, %0.2f]",
        test$p.value, test$conf.int[1], test$conf.int[2])}
```

If we have some simulated data, we can use these functions to compare the two variables 

```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(100, 0, 0.5)
x2 <- rnorm(200, 0.15, 0.9)

histogram(x1, x2)
cat(t_test(x1, x2))
```

Now we can focus on the app. It is good practice to separate the imperative code into functions, so that way the functions can focus on computations and the app can focus on responding to user actions.

Now suppose we wish to make an app to explore a bunch of simulations. 

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
    fluidRow(column(4,
                    "Distribution 1",
                    numericInput("n1", "n", value = 1000, min = 1),
                    numericInput("mean1", "mean", value = 0, step = 0.1),
                    numericInput("sd1", "std dev",
                                 value = 0.5, min = 0.1, step = 0.1)),
             column(4,
                    "Distribution 2",
                    numericInput("n2", "n", value = 1000, min = 1),
                    numericInput("mean2", "mean", value = 0, step = 0.1),
                    numericInput("sd2", "std dev",
                                 value = 0.5, min = 0.1, step = 0.1)),
             column(4,
                    "Histogram",
                    numericInput("binwidth", "Bin Width",
                                 value = 0.1, step = 0.1),
                    sliderInput("range", "Range",
                                value = c(-3, 3), min = -5, max = 5))),
    fluidRow(
        column(9, plotOutput("hist")),
        column(3, verbatimTextOutput("ttest"))))
```

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    output$hist <- renderPlot({
        x1 <- rnorm(input$n1, input$mean1, input$sd1)
        x2 <- rnorm(input$n2, input$mean2, input$sd2)
        histogram(x1, x2,
                  binwidth = input$binwidth,
                  xlim = input$range)})

    output$ttest <- renderText({
        x1 <- rnorm(input$n1, input$mean1, input$sd1)
        x2 <- rnorm(input$n2, input$mean2, input$sd2)
        t_test(x1, x2)})}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## The Reactive Graph 

Currently our reactive graph looks something like this:

#+DOWNLOADED: /tmp/screenshot.png @ 2020-01-05 17:46:52
[[file:screenshot_2020-01-05_17-46-52.png]]

This is problematic:

- The app is hard to understand because there are so many connections. There are no pieces that can be analyzed in isolation.
- The app is inefficient because it does more work than necessary. For example, if we change the breaks of the plot then the data is recalculated. If you change n1, then x2 is updated in two places 
- The histogram and the t test use separate random draws. This is misleading, as we would expect them to have the same underlying data. 

## Simplifying the Graph 

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    x1 <- reactive(rnorm(input$n1, input$mean1, input$sd1))
    x2 <- reactive(rnorm(input$n2, input$mean2, input$sd2))

    output$hist <- renderPlot({
        histogram(x1(), x2(),
                  binwidth = input$binwidth,
                  xlim = input$range)})

    output$ttest <- renderText({
        t_test(x1(), x2())})}
```

This transformation yields the simpler graph below:

#+DOWNLOADED: /tmp/screenshot.png @ 2020-01-05 17:58:45
[[file:screenshot_2020-01-05_17-58-45.png]]

As opposed to the usual rule of 3, in shiny we should consider the rule of 1 since repeating any code can have efficiency drawbacks.

## Why use reactive expressions?

If we were to just use a variable, it would throw an error since our variable is outside of a reactive context. 

If we use a function, it would be rerunning the computation every time a value changes. 

If we use a reactive expression, then it only runs the computation once, then caches it and waits until something has changed. 

# Controlling Timing of Evaluation 

```{r}

ui <- fluidPage(
    fluidRow(
        column(3,
               numericInput("lambda1", "Lambda 1", value = 3),
               numericInput("lambda2", "Lambda 2", value = 3),
               numericInput("n", "n", value = 1e4, min = 0)),
        column(9, plotOutput("hist"))))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    x1 <- reactive(rpois(n = input$n, lambda = input$lambda1))
    x2 <- reactive(rpois(n = input$n, lambda = input$lambda2))

    output$hist <- renderPlot({
        histogram(x1(), x2(),
                  binwidth = 1, xlim = c(0, 40))})}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Now that we are familiar with the basic ideas of reactivity, we will discuss two more advanced techniques which will allow us to either increase or decrease how often a reactive expression is executed. 

## Timed Invalidation 

Suppose we wish to enforce the fact that this is for simulated data by constantly resimulating the data and showing an animation rather than a static plot. We can increase the frequency of updates with a new function, reactiveTimer(). This takes a hidden input, the time and causes the graph to invalidate itself more often than it otherwise would.

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    # update every 500 ms
    timer <- reactiveTimer(500)

    x1 <- reactive({
        timer()
        rpois(input$n, input$lambda1)})

    x2 <- reactive({
        timer()
        rpois(input$n, input$lambda2)})

    output$hist <- renderPlot({
        histogram(x1(), x2(), binwidth = 1, xlim = c(0, 40))})}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


#+DOWNLOADED: /tmp/screenshot.png @ 2020-01-05 21:40:20
[[file:screenshot_2020-01-05_21-40-20.png]]

## On Click

We can also run the simulation with a click of a button. 

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
    fluidRow(
        column(3,
               numericInput("lambda1", "Lambda 1", value = 3),
               numericInput("lambda2", "Lambda 2", value = 3),
               numericInput("n", "n", value = 1e4, min = 0),
               actionButton("simulate", "Simulate!")),
        column(9, plotOutput("hist"))))
```

To use the action button properly we need to learn a new tool. If we just use the simulate button in the same way we did the timer above, we end up with an efficiency issue. x1 and x2 will update when we click the simulate button, but they will also continue to update when lambda1, lambda2, or n update. We wish to replace the dependencies, not to add to them. 

To solve this, we will use a new tool. eventReactive gives us a way to use input values without taking a reactive dependency on them. The first two arguments of event reactive specify what to take a dependency on, and what to compute. 

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    x1 <- eventReactive(input$simulate,
                        rpois(input$n, input$lambda1))

    x2 <- eventReactive(input$simulate,
                        rpois(input$n, input$lambda2))

    output$hist <- renderPlot({
        histogram(x1(), x2(), binwidth = 1, xlim = c(0, 40))})}
```

Here is the new reactive graph. The dashed lines mean that x1 and x2 continue to use the values, but no longer take a reactive dependency on them. 


#+DOWNLOADED: /tmp/screenshot.png @ 2020-01-05 22:02:08
[[file:screenshot_2020-01-05_22-02-08.png]]

## Observers 

Sometimes we need to reach outside of an app and cause side effects to happen elsewhere. This is commonly done in cases like saving a file to a network drive, sending data to a web api, updating a database, or printing a debugging message to the console. Since these don't affect the look of the app, we can't use an output and a render function. Instead we must use an observer.

observeEvent is very similar to eventReactive. It has two important arguments: eventExpr and handlerExpr. The first argument is the input or expression to take a dependency on. The second argument is the code that will be run. 

For example, in the server function below every time that name is updated, a message will be sent to the console. 

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    text <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!"))

    output$greeting <- renderText(text())
    observeEvent(input$name, message("Greeting Performed"))}
```

There are two important differences between observeEvent and eventReactive:

- You don't assign observeEvent to a variable 
- You can't refer to it from other reactive consumers 

Observers and outputs are closely related. We can think of outputs as having a special side effect: updating the html in the users browser. To emphasize this closeness, we will draw them in the reactive graph the same way.
